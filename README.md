Employing Python, I expertly engineered features, enhancing the dataset's quality and informativeness. Additionally, I harnessed Tableau for data visualization, enabling in-depth exploration of the Indian stock market within the industrial sub-sector. The project's focus was on identifying and selecting five promising stock companies for investment in Industroal Machinery Sub-Sector, with a primary emphasis on data analysis and strategic decision-making rather than model building.
